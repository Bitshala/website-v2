    q: "How does the Bitcoin Study Cohort work?",
    a: "The Bitcoin Study Cohort operates as an eight-week structured program that focuses on a comprehensive tutorial, such as ”Mastering Bitcoin”, ”Learning Bitcoin via CLI”, “Bitcoin Protocol Development” and “Programming Bitcoin”. Participants engage in self-study, group discussions, and hands-on assignments using tools like bitcoin-cli and a local bitcoind regtest node. The program covers various aspects of Bitcoin programming and development.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who can join the Bitcoin Study Cohort?",
    a: "Prerequisites may vary based on the specific cohort, as seen in the details provided under each cohort ”Mastering Bitcoin”, ”Learning Bitcoin via CLI”, “Bitcoin Protocol Development” and “Programming Bitcoin”.Beginners are suggested to get started with ”Mastering Bitcoin” or “Learning Bitcoin via CLI”.Individuals with a prior understanding of Bitcoin and, in some cases, basic CLI/programming knowledge are encouraged to apply for “Bitcoin Protocol Development” and “Programming Bitcoin“.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a fee to join the cohort?",
    a: "Our cohorts are free and open source (FOSS) and will always be. If you want to run your study program you are free to fork our git repo (containing study material, Q&A, assignment) and run it on your own.",
  },
  {
    q: "What resources are provided to participants?",
    a: "Participants in the Bitcoin Study Cohort receive comprehensive guidance through weekly group sessions, discussions, and hands-on exercises. The cohorts cover specific chapters of relevant tutorials, encouraging active participation and engagement. Teaching Assistants (TAs) are available during group sessions to clarify doubts, and participants may receive certificates upon successful completion.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I get a job after completing the cohort?",
    a: "Bitcoin is for the sovereign and not for sheep. Most FOSS projects and ventures look for proof of work before hiring. Your graduating certificate is one of those and can help in opening doors but we advise you to contribute to open-source projects (at BitShala or beyond) to increase your chances of getting hired. FOSS projects incubated by BitShala hire contributors based on the quality of engagement and contributions. We also have a job board to help you find the right Bitcoin gig/work.",

     The Bitcoin Core Review Club is a biweekly study group
    where we analyze one Bitcoin Core pull request (PR) in
    depth.

  <ul
    class="ml-10 list-disc text-base md:text-base lg:text-2xl"

    <li>
      Before each session, a PR summary and discussion
      questions are posted on GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
      We meet every other Wednesday at 7:00 PM IST on
      Discord for a live discussion.
    </li>
    <li>
      The sessions are recorded and uploaded to YouTube for
      future reference.

     Anyone looking to contribute to Bitcoin Core can
    benefit from the Review Club. While basic programming
    and Bitcoin knowledge are helpful, they're not strict
    requirements to get started. If you're curious about
    Bitcoin's codebase, eager to understand how changes get
    reviewed and merged, and want to contribute to one of
    the most impactful open-source projects, this club is
    for you.

      requests and submitting useful feedback.

    >
     Once you've participated in a few sessions and
    understand Bitcoin Core's design, testing framework, and
    review process, it's time to level up. You can start
    independently reviewing other PRs in Bitcoin Core and,
    eventually, submit your own PRs to contribute directly
    to the project.

          The BOSS Summit is a three-day, invite-only
          gathering in Dharamshala for India's most dedicated
          Bitcoin open-source contributors.
        </p>

        <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]">
          We bring together contributors from across the
          ecosystem to exchange ideas, share progress, and
          tackle problems that don't get solved in mailing
          lists or pull requests. Sessions are detailed and
          hands-on, discussions are open brainstormings, and
          everyone in the room is there because they're
          building, reviewing, or designing something that
          matters.
        </p>

        <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]">
          The pace is unhurried. Talks and sessions happen
          in a garden gazebo, not under stage lights.
          Conversations run long, and some of the most
          important ones happen off the schedule... over
          shared meals, evening walks, or while staring at
          the ocean.
        </p>

        <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]">
          It's a rare chance to step away from the noise,
          focus on the work that matters, and leave with new
          perspectives that can shape Bitcoin's future.

            The BOSS Summit is for people who already shape

            Developers, reviewers, maintainers, researchers
            — if your work touches Core, Lightning, wallets,
            privacy tools, nostr, or protocol research, this
            is where you'll find your peers.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]"></p>
            Every seat is by invitation. Not because we want
            to keep people out, but because the
            conversations move fast, go deep, and assume you
            already know the terrain.

          <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]">
            For three days, you'll be surrounded by people
            who work on the same kinds of problems you do,
            and who care about getting them right.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]"></p>
            Some sessions go deep: two-hour workshops where
            a small group pulls apart one thorny issue until
            it's clearer, cleaner, or killed entirely.
            Others are lighter: open-stage talks where
            anyone can grab the mic and share an idea, a
            pattern, or a warning worth hearing.
          </p>
          <p class="font-inter font-light text-[20px]"></p>
            You'll hear what others are building before it's
            public. You'll get candid feedback on your own
            ideas. You'll swap notes on roadblocks and
            trade-offs, and make decisions with people
            who've been in the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            And because we're in Dharamshala, it's not all sitting
            in chairs. The setting gives space for ideas to
            breathe, and for the right ones to stick.

    Bitshala is a grass-root, organic education initiative (a <a
      href="https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Pathshala"
      target="_blank"
      class="underline">pathshala</a
    >) led by Indian bitcoiners to provide guidance and
    resources for new developers starting their bitcoin
    journey.

    While a lot of Blockchain courses exist out there to
    provide surface-level API lessons on EVM like "smart
    contracts", the technical knowledge requirements for
    Bitcoin Development are much wider and nuanced.
  </p>
  <p class="m-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-2xl">
    Bitcoin is a multidisciplinary subject covering Software
    Engineering, System Engineering, Networking Protocol
    Design, Game Theory, Cryptography, Economics, and Social
    Dynamics of Complex Systems like the Market. Thus,
    creating a comprehensive bitcoin course is probably
    impossible in its entirety, and nothing in the existing
    academia and programming boot camps satisfies such
    requirements. New people trying to enter into Bitcoin
    development thus have to scour through a big set of
    parallel subject domains, not well organized and spread
    across the internet.
  </p>
  <p class="m-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-2xl">
    Thus Bitshala aims to provide the ground for ideating,
    producing, and publishing different categories of
    content in Open Source to satisfy the varied learning
    need of an aspiring Bitcoin Developer.
